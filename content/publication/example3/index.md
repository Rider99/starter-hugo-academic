abstract: Boron nitride nanosheets have superior chemical and physical properties. However, there are many problems in the preparation of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets, and an effective exfoliation method is still lacking. To solve this problem, this paper intends to obtain boron nitride nanosheets by ball milling using TpPa from COFs material as a ball milling aid, and to investigate various factors affecting the ball milling effect. The h-BN obtained by using some other polymer materials such as starch and pvp as ball milling aids were compared with the h-BN peeled by using COFs materials as ball milling aids, and the results showed that the peeling effect of using TpPa as ball milling aids was not satisfactory because the structure of COFs materials was too stable. This paper also further conducted ball milling experiments on a variety of dry auxiliaries and compared them according to the ball milling effect The strength, friction, softening point and hardness were analyzed by machine learning. The analysis revealed that these aspects affect the cross-sectional area, thickness and aspect ratio of h-BN nanosheets. To obtain good h-BN nanosheets, the main conclusions of this paper are as follows:For the cross-sectional area of hBN:the bond strength, friction, hardness and softening point of the ball milling agents have a strong influence on it and are positively correlated with it, while the friction and softening point of the ball milling agents are negatively correlated with it. For the thickness of hBN the bond strength and decomposition point of ball abrasives have influence on it, but not much, while hardness, softening point and contact angle have more influence on it, and hardness and contact angle are positively correlated with it, and softening point is negatively correlated with it. For the aspect ratio of hBNS:the hardness, softening point and contact angle of the ball abrasive have a greater effect on it, while the softening point has the greatest effect on it with a positive trend and the hardness and contact angle with a negative trend.
